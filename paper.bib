abstract = {Abstract: Accurate quantification of the blast load arising from detonation of a high explosive has applications in transport security, infrastructure assessment and defence. In order to design efficient and safe protective systems in such aggressive environments, it is of critical importance to understand the magnitude and distribution of loading on a structural component located close to an explosive charge. In particular, peak specific impulse is the primary parameter that governs structural deformation under short-duration loading. Within this so-called extreme near-field region, existing semi-empirical methods are known to be inaccurate, and high-fidelity numerical schemes are generally hampered by a lack of available experimental validation data. As such, the blast protection community is not currently equipped with a satisfactory fast-running tool for load prediction in the near-field. In this article, a validated computational model is used to develop a suite of numerical near-field blast load distributions, which are shown to follow a similar normalised shape. This forms the basis of the data-driven predictive model developed herein: a Gaussian function is fit to the normalised loading distributions, and a power law is used to calculate the magnitude of the curve according to established scaling laws. The predictive method is rigorously assessed against the existing numerical dataset, and is validated against new test models and available experimental data. High levels of agreement are demonstrated throughout, with typical variations of <5% between experiment/model and prediction. The new approach presented in this article allows the analyst to rapidly compute the distribution of specific impulse across the loaded face of a wide range of target sizes and near-field scaled distances and provides a benchmark for data-driven modelling approaches to capture blast loading phenomena in more complex scenarios.

@article{Aune2021,
abstract = {Abstract: This work presents results from a numerical investigation on the influence of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) on the dynamic response of thin steel plates subjected to blast loading. The loading was generated by a shock tube test facility designed to expose structures to blast-like loading conditions. The steel plates had an exposed area of 0.3 m x 0.3 m and experienced large deformations during the tests. Numerical simulations were performed using the finite element code EUROPLEXUS. An uncoupled FSI approach was compared to a coupled FSI approach in an attempt to investigate FSI effects. Reduced deformation was observed in the plates due to the occurrence of FSI during the dynamic response. The general trend was an increased FSI effect with increasing blast intensity. The numerical results were finally compared to the experimental data to validate their reliability in terms of deflections and velocities in the steel plates. A good agreement with the experimental data was found, and the numerical simulations were able to predict both the dynamic response of the plate and the pressure distribution in front of the plate with good accuracy. Hence, the numerical framework presented herein could be used to obtain more insight regarding the underlying physics observed in the experiments. The clear conclusion from this study is that FSI can be utilized to mitigate the blast load acting on a flexible, ductile plated structure, resulting in reduced deformations.

abstract = {Abstract: This study presents an approach for obtaining full-field dynamic surface-pressure reconstructions with low differential amplitudes. The method is demonstrated in a setup where an air jet is impinging on a flat plate. Deformations of the flat plate under dynamic loading of the impinging jet were obtained using a deflectometry setup that allows measurement of surface slopes with high accuracy and sensitivity. The measured slope information was then used as input for the virtual fields method to reconstruct pressure. Pressure fluctuations with amplitudes of down to O(1)Pa were extracted from time-resolved deflectometry data using temporal band-pass filters. Pressure transducer measurements allowed comparisons of the results with an established measurement technique. Even though the identified uncertainties in fluctuations were found to be as large as 50%, the spatial distributions of dynamic pressure events were captured well. Dynamic mode decomposition was used to identify relevant spatial information that correspond to specific frequencies. These dynamically important spatio-temporal events could be observed despite their low differential amplitudes. Finally, the limitations of the proposed pressure determination method and strategies for future improvements are discussed. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {This work presents a methodology for reconstructing full-field surface pressure information from deflectometry measurements on a thin plate using the Virtual Fields Method (VFM). Low-amplitude mean pressure distributions of the order of few O(100) Pa from an impinging air jet are investigated. These are commonly measured point-wise using arrays of pressure transducers, which require drilling holes into the specimen. In contrast, the approach presented here allows obtaining a large number of data points on the investigated specimen without impact on surface properties and flow. Deflectometry provides full-field deformation data on the specimen surface with remarkably high sensitivity. The VFM allows extracting information from the full-field data using the principle of virtual work. A finite element model is employed in combination with artificial grid deformation to assess the uncertainty of the pressure reconstructions. Both experimental and model data are presented and compared to show capabilities and restrictions of this method.},

abstract = {Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of a new shock tube facility used to produce blast loading in controlled laboratory environments. The facility was found to generate a planar shock wave over the tube cross section by measuring the pressure distribution on a massive steel plate located at the end of the tube. The properties of the shock wave proved to be a function of driver length and driver pressure, and the positive phase of the measured pressure–time histories was similar to those generated from actual far-field explosive detonations. However, the shock tube is also suited to investigate fluid–structure interaction effects and the behaviour of materials in blast events. This was demonstrated using a three-dimensional digital image correlation technique to measure the deformation field of thin steel plates. Synchronization of the three-dimensional digital image correlation and pressure measurements enabled a thorough investigation of the entire experiment and identification of fluid–structure interaction effects. Finally, one-dimensional numerical simulations were performed to investigate the wave patterns during the experiments. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},
